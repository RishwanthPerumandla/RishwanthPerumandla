### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Cloud Software Engineer** with 4+ years of experience designing scalable systems and deploying cloud-native infrastructure across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**. I specialize in backend development, DevOps, and MLOps — with a passion for translating real-world product needs into modular, high-performance software solutions.

My work blends infrastructure as code, API design, and ML/GenAI platform deployment. I believe in building systems that are not only scalable and efficient, but also secure, observable, and easy to maintain.
