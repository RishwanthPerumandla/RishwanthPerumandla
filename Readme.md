### ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Cloud & Machine Learning Engineer with a background in product development, MLOps, and GenAI integration. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Purdue University Fort Wayne and have 3+ years of experience working on real-world, scalable systemsâ€”from AI research platforms to multi-role SaaS products.

ðŸ”§ I work with technologies like Python, Node.js, React, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, and tools like MLflow, DVC, and OpenAI/Hugging Face APIs.

ðŸ§  My interests lie at the intersection of AI, cloud infrastructure, and product engineering â€” building systems that are robust, modular, and meaningful.
